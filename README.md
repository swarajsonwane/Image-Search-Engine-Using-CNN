In this project I have used convolutional neural network deep learning algoritm to search similar 
images from our Database ( Cifar).

# Convolution Nural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. 
The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
